# Kiss ECC ⇒ Keep It Simple Stupid ECC

In fact, this is a toy example for working with ECC.  
Everything is organized using traits to help you understand both how to use the code and how it works.

## Toy Example for ECC

This is a toy example that includes code from:

* [https://gist.github.com/bellbind/1414867](https://gist.github.com/bellbind/1414867)
* [https://ed25519.cr.yp.to/software.html](https://ed25519.cr.yp.to/software.html)
* [https://github.com/gbanegas/KissECC](https://github.com/gbanegas/KissECC) (Python version)

## About This Work

* It is not fast.
* It is not secure.
* You should never use it in "real" applications.

## What You Should Do

If you are interested in seeing the code in action or if you want to learn through small examples, keep reading.
